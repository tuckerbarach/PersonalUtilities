# PersonalUtilities

Personal Utilities
A Java application meant for desktop use that combines a to-do list, reminders, and a calendar all in one space.

Motivation
This project was my final project for an Advanced Java class I took in my Junior year of high school (age 16) with the purpose of helping myself be more efficient in the future by utilizing my very own application.

Build Status
Personal Utilities is nearly complete, with just one key feature missing. I intended to make the Calendar feature of the application link with your Google Calendar. However, I could not get the Google API to link up properly. Additionally, the timer feature may incorrectly countdown and thus be inaccurate.
